Project Problem Statement 

Building a Next Best Action model for Standard Bank

Modern customer analytics and personalization systems use a wide variety of methods that help to reveal and quantify customer preferences and intent, making marketing messages, ads, offers, and recommendations more relevant and engaging. However, most of these methods are designed to optimize only one immediate interaction with a customer and use objective functions defined through metrics like a click-through rate (CTR) or conversion rate (CR). This problem can be particularly important in industries like retail banking and telecom where customer relationships evolve over long periods of time.

In this project we must combine high performing classification engine with recommendation engine. 

This Project consists of two stages:

Stage-1: Classification Engine: Create High Performing Classification Engine(Which Classifies Churn customer or non-churn customer based on data provided)

Stage-2: Recommendation Engine: Create a dummy dataset related to Types of Churn customers and right product recommendation to make them non churn customers. Note1: Recommendations need to increase more conversion rate, so we can convert churn customers into non-churn customers.

Note2: With improper classification engine, we can make this Next Best Action project successful. So, make sure classification engine going to give high quality performance. 

Submit the Script, Dummy Dataset for Recommendation engine & PowerPoint
